## About
Rehashing a past project as a multi-part application based on Drupal 8, CouchDB, Angular, and AWS S3 / CloudFront

I'm also trying to make this as modular as possible. So far, components of the app are going in their own directories
with `README.md` files, whatever templates they might use, and eventually test files will go in as well. Ideally, components
are relatively unaware (decoupled) from eachother.

I think using the stateless components features of 1.5 will be nice.

Hopefully I can wrangle Drupal 8 into being something I actually want to use.
